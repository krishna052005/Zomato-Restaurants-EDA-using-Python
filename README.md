#Zomato Restaurants – Exploratory Data Analysis

A two-level EDA project performed in Python to understand the structure, distribution, and insights of the Zomato restaurants dataset.

📌 Level 1 Tasks – Basic EDA
1. Importing Libraries

Loaded essential Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data handling and visualization.

2. Loading the Dataset

Read the Zomato dataset using pandas.read_csv().

3. Dataset Overview

Displayed first and last few records (head(), tail()).

Checked dataset shape (rows & columns).

Viewed column names and datatypes.

4. Handling Missing Values

Identified missing values.

Performed appropriate cleaning (dropping or imputing based on column requirements).

5. Descriptive Statistics

Generated summary stats using describe().

Examined numerical and categorical distributions.

6. Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates.

Standardized column formats.

Handled inconsistent or noisy data.

7. Visual Explorations

Created exploratory plots:

Distribution plots

Count plots

Rating distribution

📌 Level 2 Tasks – Advanced EDA
1. Restaurant Chain Analysis

Grouped data by restaurant name.

Calculated branch count for each chain.

Identified the top 10 restaurant chains.

2. Average Rating Analysis

Computed average rating for each chain.

Retrieved the top 10 highest-rated restaurant chains.

3. Visualization of Insights

Plotted horizontal bar charts for:

Top 10 chains by branch count.

Top 10 chains by average rating.

Used matplotlib for clean and clear visual interpretation.
